<h1 align="center">Hi, I’m Timothy 👋</h1>
I’m a data scientist and AI engineer who enjoys turning messy data into working models and ideas into reliable systems. Most of my work lives at the intersection of machine learning, solid software engineering, and curiosity driven experimentation.
This GitHub is where I build, test, and occasionally break things. You’ll find projects ranging from model development and optimization to tooling, infrastructure, and side experiments that explore how intelligent systems behave in the real world.
<br><br>
I’m always open to exchanging ideas, collaborating on interesting problems, or discussing anything related to data, models, or systems. If you enjoy thoughtful engineering and practical AI, feel free to reach out.
I also spend time solving algorithmic problems to stay sharp. You can find those over on

<h2 align="center">What I Work With 🧠</h2>
I care about tools that scale well, models that are understandable, and systems that survive outside notebooks. This stack reflects what I currently use most in production and research oriented work.
